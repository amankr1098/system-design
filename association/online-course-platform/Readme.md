### Design Online Course Platform

**Problem:** Build a course platform where instructors create courses and students enroll in them. This exercise practices unidirectional and one-to-many associations.

**Requirements:**

- `Instructor` with a name and a list of `Course` objects they teach. An `addCourse(course)` method that adds the course and sets the instructor on the course.
- `Course` with a title, an `Instructor` reference, and a list of enrolled `Student` objects. An `enrollStudent(student)` method that adds the student and sets the enrolled course on the student.
- `Student` with a name and an `enrolledCourse` reference (the course they're currently taking). A `getInstructorName()` method that navigates through the course to return the instructor's name.
