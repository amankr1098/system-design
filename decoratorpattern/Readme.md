# Decorator Pattern
## Defination - The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add or modify the behavior of an object at runtime without altering its structure. It achieves this by wrapping the original object with a series of decorator classes that each provide additional functionality. 

It is widely used when we have a base class and we want to add more features on top of base as wll as modified class or object at runtime. . 
Ex :- Pizza , where we can add multiple toppings
    Laptops or mobile phone, where we have a base varient and we can select the storage and ram on top of it. 
    Cars also have base varient and we can add multiple advance features in base varient on top of it.
